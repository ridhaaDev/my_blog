      "content": "Before dying at the age of 39, Blaise Pascal made huge contributions to both physics and mathematics, notably in fluids, geometry, and probability. This work, however, would influence more than just the realm of the natural sciences. Many fields that we now classify under the heading of social science did, in fact, also grow out of the foundation he helped lay. Interestingly enough, much of this was done in his teen years, with some of it coming in his twenties.",

For contemporaries entangled, as we are, in the inexorable demands of daily life, the dividing lines between eras may be hardly visible when crossed; only after people stumble over them do the lines grow into wall which irretrievably shut off the past.”",
